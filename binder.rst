Binder
======

.. questions::

   - Why sharing code is not sufficient?
   - How to share computational environment?
   - What is Binder?
   - How to binderize my python repository?

.. objectives::

   - Learn about reproducible computational environments
   - Learn to create and share custom computing environments with myBinder



Exercise
---------

Lea is a PhD student in computational biology and after 2 years of intensive work, she is finally ready to publish her first paper. The code she has used for analyzing her data is available on github but her supervisor who is an advocate of Open Science told her that sharing code is not sufficient.

- Why isn't enough to share your code?

We form small groups (4-5 persons) and discuss in groups. If the workshop is online, each group will join a breakout room.

Each group write a summary (bullet points) of the discussion in the workshop shared document (the link will be provided by your instructors).


Exercise
---------

The main objective of this exercise is to learn to fork a repository and add a requirement file to share the computational environment with myBinder.
