   - Why using NumPy instead of pure python?

   - Be able to use basic NumPy functionality
   - Understand enough of NumPy to seach for answers to the rest of your questions ;)


So, we already know about python lists, and that we can put all kinds of things in there.
But in scientific usage, lists are often not enough. They are slow and
not very flexible.

.. highlight:: python

What is an array?
-----------------

For example, consider ``[1, 2.5, 'asdf', False, [1.5, True]]`` -
this is a Python list but it has different types for every
element.  When you do math on this, every element has to be handled separately.

NumPy is the most used library for scientific computing. 
Even if you are not using it directly, chances are high that some library uses it in the background.
NumPy provides the high-performance multidimensional array object and tools to use it. 

An array is a 'grid' of values, with all the same types. It is indexed by tuples of
non negative indices and provides the framework for multiple
dimensions.  An array has:

* ``dtype`` - data type.  Arrays always contain one type
* ``shape`` - shape of the data, for example ``3×2`` or ``3×2×500`` or even
  ``500`` (one dimensional) or ``[]`` (zero dimensional).
* ``data`` - raw data storage in memory.  This can be passed to C or
  Fortran code for efficient calculations.


To test the performance of pure Python vs NumPy we can write in our jupyter notebook:

Create one list and one 'empty' list, to store the result in ::

  a = list(range(10000))
  b = [ 0 ] * 10000

In a new cell starting with ``%%timeit``, loop through the list ``a`` and fill the second list ``b`` with ``a`` squared ::
  
  %%timeit
  for i in range(len(a)):
    b[i] = a[i]**2

That looks and feels quite fast. But let's take a look at how NumPy performs for the same task.

So for the NumPy example, create one array and one 'empty' array to store the result in ::

  import numpy as np
  a = np.arange(10000)
  b = np.zeros(10000)

In a new cell starting with ``%%timeit``, fill ``b`` with ``a`` squared ::

  %%timeit
  b = a ** 2

We see that compared to working with numpy arrays, working with traditional python lists is actually slow.


Creating arrays
---------------

There are different ways of creating arrays::

  a = np.array([1,2,3])               # 1-dimensional array (rank 1)
  b = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])     # 2-dimensional array (rank 2)

  b.shape                             # the shape (rows,columns)
  b.size                              # number of elements 

In addition to above ways of creating arrays, there are many other ways of creating arrays depending on content::

   np.zeros((2, 3))           # 2x3 array with all elements 0
   np.ones((1,2))             # 1x2 array with all elements 1
   np.full((2,2),7)           # 2x2 array with all elements 7
   np.eye(2)                  # 2x2 identity matrix

   np.arange(10)              # Evenly spaced values in an interval
   np.linspace(0,9,10)        # same as above, see exercise

   c = np.ones((3,3))
   d = np.ones((3, 2), bool)  # 3x2 boolean array

Arrays can also be stored and read from a (.npy) file:: 

   np.save('x.npy', a)           # save the array a to a .npy file
   x = np.load('x.npy')          # load an array from a .npy file and store it in variable x

In many occasions (especially when something goes different than expected) it is useful to check and control the datatype of the array::

   d.dtype                    # datatype of the array
   d.astype('int')            # change datatype from boolean to integer

In the last example, ``.astype('int')``, it will make a **copy** of the
array, and re-allocate data - unless the dtype is exactly the same as
before.  Understanding and minimizing copies is one of the most
important things to do for speed.


.. challenge::

   - **Datatypes** Try out ``np.arange(10)`` and ``np.linspace(0,9,10)``, what is the difference? Can you adjust one to do the same as the other?

   - **Datatypes** Create a 3x2 array of random float numbers (check ``np.random``) between 0 and 1. Now change the arrays datatype to int (``array.astype``). How does the array look like? 

   - **Reshape** Create a 3x2 array of random integer numbers between 0 and 10. Reshape the array in any way possible. What is not possible?

   - **NumPyI/O** Save above array to .npy file (``np.save``) and read it in again.

.. solution::

   - **Datatypes** ``np.arange(10)`` results in ``array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])`` with dtype **int64**, 
   while ``np.linspace(0,9,10)`` results in ``array([0., 1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9.])`` with dtype **float64**. 
   Both ``np.linspace`` and ``np.arange`` take dtype as an argument and can be adjusted to match each other in that way.

   - **Datatypes** eg ``a = np.random.random((3,2))``. ``a.astype('int')`` results in an all zero array, not as maybe expected the rounded int.

   - **Reshape** eg ``b = np.random.randint(0,10,(3,2))``. ``b.reshape((6,1))`` and ``b.reshape((2,3))`` possible. It is not possible to reshape to shapes using more or less elements than ``b.size = 6``.

   - **NumPyI/O** ``np.save('x.npy', b)`` and ``x = np.load('x.npy')`` 



Array maths
------------

Clearly, you can do math on arrays.  Math in NumPy, is very fast
because it is implemented in C or Fortran - just like most other
high-level languages such as R, Matlab, etc do.

By default, in NumPy all math is element-by-element.  This is unlike
Matlab, where most things are element-by-element, but ``*`` becomes
array multiplication.  NumPy values consistency and does not treat
2-dimensional arrays specially::

  a = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
  b = np.array([[5,6],[7,8]])

  c = a + b
  d = np.add(a,b)

Also: - (``np.subtract()``), * (``np.multiply()``), / (``np.divide()``), ``np.sqrt()``, ``np.sum()``, ``np.mean()``, ...


.. challenge::

   - **Matrix multiplication** What is the difference between ``np.multiply`` and ``np.dot`` ? Try it.
   - **Axis** What is the difference between ``np.sum(axis=1)`` vs
     ``np.sum(axis=0)`` on a two-dimensional array? What if you leave out the axis parameter?


.. solution::

   - **Matrix multiplication** ``np.multiply`` does elementwise multiplication on two arrays, while ``np.dot`` enables matrix multiplication.
   - **Axis** ``axis=1`` does the operation (here: ``np.sum``) over each row, while axis=0 does it over each column. If axis is left out, the sum of the full array is given.



Indexing and Slicing
--------------------

NumPy has many ways to extract values out of arrays:

- You can select a single element
- You can select rows or columns
- You can select ranges where a condition is true.

Clever and efficient use of these operations is a key to NumPy's
speed: you should try to cleverly use these selectors (written in C)
to extract data to be used with other NumPy functions written in C or
Fortran.  This will give you the benefits of Python with most of the
speed of C.

::

  a = np.arange(16)      # 4x4 identity matrix
  a[0]               # first row
  a[:,0]             # first column
  a[1:3,1:3]         # middle 2x2 array

  a[(0, 1), (1, 1)]  # second element of first and second row as array

Boolean indexing on above created array::

  idx = (a > 0)      # creates boolean matrix of same size as a 
  a[idx]             # array with matching values of above criterion
  
  a[a > 0]           # same as above in one line 


.. challenge::

   ::

      a = np.eye(4)
      b = a[:,0]
      b[0] = 5

   - **View vs copy** Try out above code. How does ``a`` look like before ``b`` has changed and after? How could it be avoided?

.. solution::

   - **View vs copy** The change in ``b`` has also changed the array ``a``! This is because ``b`` is merely a view of a part of array ``a``. 
   Both variables point to the same memory. Hence, if one is changed, the other one also changes. If you need to keep the original array as is, use ``np.copy(a)``.



.. challenge::

   - **NumPy functionality** Create two 2D arrays and do matrix multiplication first manually (for loop), then using the ``np.dot`` function. Use ``%%timeit`` to compare execution times. What is happening?

.. solution::

   - **Numpy functionality**


Types of operations
-------------------

There are different types of standard operations in NumPy:

**ufuncs**, "universal functions": These are element-by-element
functions with standardized arguments:

- One, two, or three input arguments
- For example, ``a + b`` is similar to ``np.add(a, b)`` but the ufunc
  has more control.
- ``out=`` output argument, store output in this array (rather than
  make a new array) - saves copying data!
- See the `full reference
  <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/ufuncs.html>`__

- They also do **broadcasting**.  Can you add a 1-dimensional array of shape `(3)`
  to an 2-dimensional array of shape `(3, 2)`?   With broadcasting you
  can!

  ::

     a = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6]])
     b = np.array([10, 10, 10])
     a + b                       # array([[11, 12, 13],
                                 #        [14, 15, 16]])

  Broadcasting is smart and consistent about what it does, which I'm
  not clever enough to explain quickly here: `the manual page on
  broadcasting
  <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html>`__.
  The basic idea is that it expands dimensions of the smaller array so
  that they are compatible in shape.

**Array methods** do something to one array:

- Some of these are the same as ufuncs::

     x = np.arange(12)
     x.shape = (3, 4)
     x                    #  array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
                          #         [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
                          #         [ 8,  9, 10, 11]])
     x.max()              #  11
     x.max(axis=0)        #  array([ 8,  9, 10, 11])
     x.max(axis=1)        #  array([ 3,  7, 11])

**Other functions**: there are countless other functions covering
linear algebra, scientific functions, etc.


.. challenge::

   - **In-place addition**: Create an array, add it to itself using a
     ufunc.

   - **In-place addition** (advanced): Create an array of
     ``dtype='float'``, and an array of ``dtype='int'``.  Try to use the
     int array is the output argument of the first two arrays.

.. solution::

   - **in-place addition**::

       x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
       id(x)                        # get the memory-ID of x
       np.add(x, x, x)              # Third argument is output array
       np.add(x, x, x)
       print(x)
       id(x)                        # get the memory-ID of x
                                    # - notice  it is the same

     You note that ``np.add()`` has a third argument that is the
     output array (same as ``out=``), *and* the function returns that
     same array.



Linear algebra and other advanced math
--------------------------------------

In addition to the array type, there is a ``matrix`` type which is
specialized:

- two-dimensional only
- ``*`` operator is matrix multiplication

Matrix or not, there are many different functions available:

- `Linear algebra in numpy
  <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.linalg.html>`__

- `Scipy <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/>`__ has even
  more functions

- Many other libraries use NumPy arrays as the standard data
  structure: they take data in this format, and return it similarly.
  Thus, all the other packages you may want to use are compatible

- If you need to write your own fast code in C, NumPy arrays can be
  used to pass data.  This is known as `extending Python
  <https://docs.python.org/3/extending/>`__.


.. challenge::

   - **Matrixes are always 2D** (advanced) Make a 2x3 array and a 2x3 matrix.
     Extract just the first row of each of them and check the ``.shape``.


.. keypoints::

   - NumPy is a powerful library every scientist using python should know about, since many other libraries also use it internally.
   - Be aware of some NumPy specific pecularities



Additional Exercises
--------------------

1. Reverse a vector. Given a vector, reverse it such that the last
   element becomes the first, e.g. ``[1, 2, 3]`` => ``[3, 2, 1]``

2. Create a 2D array with zeros on the borders and 1 inside.

3. Create a random array with elements [0, 1), then add 10 to all
   elements in the range [0.2, 0.7).

4. What is ``np.round(0.5)``? What is ``np.round(1.5)``? Why?

5. In addition to ``np.round``, explore ``np.ceil``, ``np.floor``,
   ``np.trunc``. In particular, take note of how they behave with
   negative numbers.

6. Recall the identity :math:`\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1`. Create a
   random 4x4 array with values in the range [0, 10). Now test the
   equality with ``np.equal``. What result do you get with
   ``np.allclose`` instead of ``np.equal``?

7. Create a 1D array with 10 random elements. Sort it.

8. What's the difference between ``np_array.sort()`` and
   ``np.sort(np_array)``?

9. For the random array in question 8, instead of sorting it, perform
   an indirect sort. That is, return the list of indices which would
   index the array in sorted order.

10. Create a 4x4 array of zeros, and another 4x4 array of ones. Next
    combine them into a single 8x4 array with the content of the zeros
    array on top and the ones on the bottom.  Finally, do the same,
    but create a 4x8 array with the zeros on the left and the ones on
    the rigth.


.. solution::

   1. One solution is:: 
    
       a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
       a[::-1]
        
   2. One solution is::
        
       b = np.ones((10,10))
       b[:,[0, -1]]=0
       b[[0, -1],:]=0

   3. A possible solution is::
        
       x = np.random.rand(100)
       y = x + 10*(x >= 0.2)*(x < 0.7)
    
   4. For values exactly halfway between rounded decimal values, NumPy rounds to the nearest even value.

   5. Let's test those functions with few negative and positive values::

       a = np.array([-3.3, -2.5, -1.5, -0.75, -0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 1.5, 2.5, 3])
       np.round(a)
       np.ceil(a)
       np.floor(a)
       np.trun(a)

   6. One solution is::

       x = 10*np.random.rand(4,4)
       oo = np.ones((4,4))
       s2c2 = np.square(np.sin(x))+np.square(np.cos(x))
       np.equal(oo,s2c2)
       np.allclose(oo,s2c2)

   7. Sorting the array itself, without copying it::
        
       x = np.random.rand(10)
       x.sort()

   8. NumPy.sort() returns a sorted copy of an array. 

   9. ``np.argsort(x)``

   10. One solution is::

       z = np.zeros((4,4))
       o = np.ones((4,4))
       np.concatenate((z,o))
       np.concatenate((z,o),axis=1)
