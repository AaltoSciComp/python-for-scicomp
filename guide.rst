Instructor's guide
==================

Learner personas
----------------

A is a early career PhD researcher who has been using Python a bit,
but is not sure what they know or don't know.  They want to be able to
do their research more efficiently and make sure that they are using
the right tools.  A may know that numpy exists, etc. and could
theoretically read some about it themselves, but aren't sure if they
are going in the right direction.

A2 can use numpy and pandas, but have learned little bits here and
there and hasn't had a comprehensive introduction.  They want to
ensure they are using best practices.  (Baseline of high-level
packages)

B is a mid-to-late undergraduate student who has used Python in some
classes.  They have possibly learned the syntax and enough to use it
in courses, but in a course-like manner where they are expected to
create everything themselves.


Prerequisites:
- Knowing basic Python syntax
- Watch the command line crash course, if you aren't familiar.

Not prerequisites:
- Any external libraries, e.g. numpy
- Knowing how to make scripts or use Jupyter
