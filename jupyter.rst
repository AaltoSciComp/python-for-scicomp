Jupyter
=======

.. questions::

   - Q1
   - Q2

.. objectives::

   - Be able to use Jupyter to run examples for the rest of the course
   - Be able to run Jupyter in a directory do your own work.



Getting started with Jupyter
----------------------------

.. challenge::

   1. Start Jupyter.

   2. Create a notebook file.

   3. What directory does Jupyter show you.  How can you access
      files in other directories?

   4. (advanced, optional) Look at the notebook file in a text
      editor.  How does it work?

   If everything works for you, this will end very quickly.  Begin
   reading the next sections independently.



Running code in Jupyter
-----------------------

.. challenge::

   1. Run some trivial code, such as ``print(1)``.

   2. Run some slightly less trivial code, like print out the first
      ten `Fibonacci numbers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number>`__.

   3. Make a Markdown cell and give it a title and some description of
      your function

   4. Use the ``%%timeit`` magic function to time your Fibonacci
      function.

   5. Again using ``%%timeit``, figure out the fastest way to sum the
      numbers 0 to 1000000.



Jupyter pitfalls
----------------

.. challenge::

   (optional) Discuss the following in groups:

   1. Have any of you used Jupyter in a way that became impossible to
      maintain: too many files, code all spread out, not able to find
      your code and run it in the right order.  How did you solve that?

   2. On the other hand, what are your successes with Jupyter?
