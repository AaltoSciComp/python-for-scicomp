# Productivity tools and Profiling

## Productivity tools

```{questions}
   - Do you have preferences on the visual aspects of the code
     and how it should look?
   - Do you use any tools that help you create better looking
     code faster?
```

```{objectives}
   - Learn tools that can help you be more productive.
   - Learn how to follow standards that other people have created
     and how to pick your own favorite.
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Left to do: Summarize [Productivity tools lecture](/content/productivity.rst) in 20 minutes.


## Profiling

```{questions}
   - When shall we worry about the performance of our code?
   - How do we find bottlenecks in our code?
   - How do we measure improvements in running time and memory usage?
```

```{objectives}
   - Understand when improving code performance is worth the time and effort.
   - Learn how to use profilers in Python.
   - Use `scalene` to find and optimize bottlenecks in a given code example.
```


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Left to do:
> Give 20 minutes introduction to profiling:
> - [ ] Discuss when to profile
> - [ ] Discuss breifly manual profiling
> - [ ] Introduce function call profilers
> - [ ] Introduce line profilers
> - [ ] Visualize one code example using `scalane`

## Exercise
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Prepare two exercises for the last 20 minutes of this lecture.
> Left to do:
> - [ ] Provide exercise in pure python, Radovan has some ideas
> - [ ] Provide exercise showing the improvement in performance when introducing numpy and/or pandas, Gregor will work on this
