Pandas is a Python package that provides high-performance and easy to use
data structures and data analysis tools.
This page provides a brief overview of pandas, but the open source community
developing the pandas package has also created excellent documentation and training
material, including:

- a  `Getting started guide <https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html>`__
  (including tutorials and a 10 minute flash intro)
- a `"10 minutes to pandas" <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html#min>`__
  tutorial
- thorough `Documentation <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/>`__ containing a user guide,
  API reference and contribution guide
- a `cheatsheet <https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf>`__
- a `cookbook <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/cookbook.html#cookbook>`__.

A quick Pandas preview
----------------------

.. thebe-button::

Let's get a flavor of what we can do with pandas (you won't be able to follow everything yet). We will be working with an example dataset containing the passenger list from the Titanic, which is often used in Kaggle competitions and data science tutorials. First step is to load pandas::

    import pandas as pd

We can download the data from `this GitHub repository <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandas-dev/pandas/master/doc/data/titanic.csv>`__
by visiting the page and saving it to disk, or by directly reading into
a :class:`~pandas.DataFrame`::

    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandas-dev/pandas/master/doc/data/titanic.csv"
    titanic = pd.read_csv(url, index_col='Name')

We can now view the dataframe to get an idea of what it contains and
print some summary statistics of its numerical data::

    # print the first 5 lines of the dataframe
    titanic.head()

::

    # print summary statistics for each column
    titanic.describe()

Ok, so we have information on passenger names, survival (0 or 1), age,
ticket fare, number of siblings/spouses, etc. With the summary statistics we see that the average age is 29.7 years, maximum ticket price is 512 USD, 38\% of passengers survived, etc.

Let's say we're interested in the survival probability of different
age groups. With two one-liners, we can find the average age of those
who survived or didn't survive, and plot corresponding histograms of
the age distribution (:meth:`pandas.DataFrame.groupby`, :meth:`pandas.DataFrame.hist`)::

    print(titanic.groupby("Survived")["Age"].mean())

::

    titanic.hist(column='Age', by='Survived', bins=25, figsize=(8,10),
		 layout=(2,1), zorder=2, sharex=True, rwidth=0.9);


Clearly, pandas dataframes allows us to do advanced analysis with very few commands, but it takes a while to get used to how dataframes work so let's get back to basics.

.. callout:: Getting help

    Series and DataFrames have a lot functionality, but
    how can we find out what methods are available and how they work? One way is to visit
    the `API reference <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html>`__
    and reading through the list.
    Another way is to use the autocompletion feature in Jupyter and type e.g.
    ``titanic["Age"].`` in a notebook and then hit ``TAB`` twice - this should open
    up a list menu of available methods and attributes.

    Jupyter also offers quick access to help pages (docstrings) which can be
    more efficient than searching the internet. Two ways exist:

    - Write a function name followed by question mark and execute the cell, e.g.
      write ``titanic.hist?`` and hit ``SHIFT + ENTER``.
    - Write the function name and hit ``SHIFT + TAB``.
    - Right click and select "Show contextual help".  This tab will
      update with help for anything you click.


What's in a dataframe?
----------------------

As we saw above, pandas dataframes are a powerful tool for working with tabular data.
A pandas
:class:`pandas.DataFrame`
is composed of rows and columns:

.. image:: img/pandas/01_table_dataframe.svg

Each column of a dataframe is a :class:`pandas.Series` object
- a dataframe is thus a collection of series::

    # print some information about the columns
    titanic.info()

Unlike a NumPy array, a dataframe can combine multiple data types, such as
numbers and text, but the data in each column is of the same type. So we say a
column is of type ``int64`` or of type ``object``.

Let's inspect one column of the Titanic passenger list data (first downloading
and reading the titanic.csv datafile into a dataframe if needed, see above)::

    titanic["Age"]
    titanic.Age          # same as above

::

    type(titanic["Age"]) # a pandas Series object

The columns have names. Here's how to get them (:attr:`~pandas.DataFrame.columns`)::

    titanic.columns

However, the rows also have names! This is what Pandas calls the :obj:`~pandas.DataFrame.index`::

    titanic.index

We saw above how to select a single column, but there are many ways of
selecting (and setting) single or multiple rows, columns and
values. We can refer to columns and rows either by their name
(:attr:`~pandas.DataFrame.loc`, :attr:`~pandas.DataFrame.at`) or by
their index (:attr:`~pandas.DataFrame.iloc`,
:attr:`~pandas.DataFrame.iat`)::

    titanic.loc['Lam, Mr. Ali',"Age"]          # select single value by row and column
    titanic.loc[:'Lam, Mr. Ali',"Survived":"Age"]  # slice the dataframe by row and column *names*
    titanic.iloc[0:2,3:6]                      # same slice as above by row and column *numbers*

    titanic.at['Lam, Mr. Ali',"Age"] = 42      # set single value by row and column *name* (fast)
    titanic.at['Lam, Mr. Ali',"Age"]           # select single value by row and column *name* (fast)
    titanic.iat[0,5]                           # select same value by row and column *number* (fast)

    titanic["is_passenger"] = True             # set a whole column

Dataframes also support boolean indexing, just like we saw for ``numpy``
arrays::

    titanic[titanic["Age"] > 70]
    # ".str" creates a string object from a column
    titanic[titanic.index.str.contains("Margaret")]

What if your dataset has missing data? Pandas uses the value :py:data:`numpy.nan`
to represent missing data, and by default does not include it in any computations.
We can find missing values, drop them from our dataframe, replace them
with any value we like or do forward or backward filling::

    titanic.isna()                    # returns boolean mask of NaN values
    titanic.dropna()                  # drop missing values
    titanic.dropna(how="any")         # or how="all"
    titanic.dropna(subset=["Cabin"])  # only drop NaNs from one column
    titanic.fillna(0)                 # replace NaNs with zero
    titanic.fillna(method='ffill')    # forward-fill NaNs



Exercises 1
-----------

.. challenge:: Exploring dataframes

    - Have a look at the available methods and attributes using the
      `API reference <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html>`__
      or the autocomplete feature in Jupyter.
    - Try out a few methods using the Titanic dataset and have a look at
      the docstrings (help pages) of methods that pique your interest
    - Compute the mean age of the first 10 passengers by slicing and the :py:meth:`pandas.DataFrame.mean` method
    - (Advanced) Using boolean indexing, compute the survival rate
      (mean of "Survived" values) among passengers over and under the average age.

   .. solution::

       - Mean age of the first 10 passengers::

	   titanic.iloc[:10,:]["Age"].mean()

	 or::

	   titanic.loc[:"Nasser, Mrs. Nicholas (Adele Achem)","Age"].mean()

	 or::

	   titanic.iloc[:10,4].mean()

       - Survival rate among passengers over and under average age::

	   titanic[titanic["Age"] > titanic["Age"].mean()]["Survived"].mean()

	 and::

	   titanic[titanic["Age"] < titanic["Age"].mean()]["Survived"].mean()


Tidy data
---------

The above analysis was rather straightforward thanks to the fact
that the dataset is *tidy*.

.. image:: img/pandas/tidy_data.png

In short, columns should be variables and rows should be measurements,
and adding measurements (rows) should then not require any changes to code
that reads the data.

What would untidy data look like? Here's an example from
some run time statistics from a 1500 m running event::

    runners = pd.DataFrame([
		  {'Runner': 'Runner 1', 400: 64, 800: 128, 1200: 192, 1500: 240},
		  {'Runner': 'Runner 2', 400: 80, 800: 160, 1200: 240, 1500: 300},
		  {'Runner': 'Runner 3', 400: 96, 800: 192, 1200: 288, 1500: 360},
	      ])

What makes this data untidy is that the column names `400, 800, 1200, 1500`
indicate the distance ran. In a tidy dataset, this distance would be a variable
on its own, making each runner-distance pair a separate observation and hence a
separate row.

To make untidy data tidy, a common operation is to "melt" it,
which is to convert it from wide form to a long form::

    runners = pd.melt(runners, id_vars="Runner",
		  value_vars=[400, 800, 1200, 1500],
		  var_name="distance",
		  value_name="time"
	      )

In this form it's easier to **filter**, **group**, **join**
and **aggregate** the data, and it's also easier to model relationships
between variables.

The opposite of melting is to *pivot* data, which can be useful to
view data in different ways as we'll see below.

For a detailed exposition of data tidying, have a look at
`this article <http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf>`__.



Working with dataframes
-----------------------

We saw above how we can read in data into a dataframe using the :func:`~pandas.read_csv` function.
Pandas also understands multiple other formats, for example using :obj:`~pandas.read_excel`,
:obj:`~pandas.read_hdf`, :obj:`~pandas.read_json`, etc. (and corresponding methods to write to file:
:obj:`~pandas.DataFrame.to_csv`, :obj:`~pandas.DataFrame.to_excel`, :obj:`~pandas.DataFrame.to_hdf`, :obj:`~pandas.DataFrame.to_json`, etc.)

But sometimes you would want to create a dataframe from scratch. Also this can be done
in multiple ways, for example starting with a numpy array (see
:class:`~pandas.DataFrame` docs)::

    import numpy as np
    dates = pd.date_range('20130101', periods=6)
    df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(6, 4), index=dates, columns=list('ABCD'))
    df

or a dictionary (see same docs)::

    df = pd.DataFrame({'A': ['dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'dog'],
		       'B': ['one', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'two', 'two', 'one', 'three'],
		       'C': np.array([3] * 8, dtype='int32'),
		       'D': np.random.randn(8),
		       'E': np.random.randn(8)})
    df

There are many ways to operate on dataframes. Let's look at a
few examples in order to get a feeling of what's possible
and what the use cases can be.

We can easily split and :func:`concatenate <pandas.concat>` dataframes::

    sub1, sub2, sub3 = df[:2], df[2:4], df[4:]
    pd.concat([sub1, sub2, sub3])

When pulling data from multiple dataframes, a powerful :obj:`pandas.DataFrame.merge` method is
available that acts similarly to merging in SQL. Say we have a dataframe containing the age of some athletes::

    age = pd.DataFrame([
	{"Runner": "Runner 4", "Age": 18},
	{"Runner": "Runner 2", "Age": 21},
	{"Runner": "Runner 1", "Age": 23},
	{"Runner": "Runner 3", "Age": 19},
    ])

We now want to use this table to annotate the original ``runners`` table from
before with their age. Note that the ``runners`` and ``age`` dataframes have a
different ordering to it, and ``age`` has an entry for ``Dave`` which is not
present in the ``runners`` table. We can let Pandas deal with all of it using
the :obj:`~pandas.DataFrame.merge` method::

    # Add the age for each runner
    runners.merge(age, on="Runner")

In fact, much of what can be done in SQL
`is also possible with pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/comparison/comparison_with_sql.html>`__.

:obj:`~pandas.DataFrame.groupby` is a powerful method which splits a dataframe and aggregates data
in groups. To see what's possible, let's return to the Titanic dataset. Let's
test the old saying "Women and children first". We start by creating a new
column ``Child`` to indicate whether a passenger was a child or not, based on
the existing ``Age`` column. For this example, let's assume that you are a
child when you are younger than 12 years::

    titanic["Child"] = titanic["Age"] < 12

Now we can test the saying by grouping the data on ``Sex`` and then creating further sub-groups based on ``Child``::

    titanic.groupby(["Sex", "Child"])["Survived"].mean()

Here we chose to summarize the data by its mean, but many other common
statistical functions are available as dataframe methods, like
:obj:`~pandas.DataFrame.std`, :obj:`~pandas.DataFrame.min`,
:obj:`~pandas.DataFrame.max`, :obj:`~pandas.DataFrame.cumsum`,
:obj:`~pandas.DataFrame.median`, :obj:`~pandas.DataFrame.skew`,
:obj:`~pandas.DataFrame.var` etc.



Exercises 2
-----------

.. challenge:: Analyze the Titanic passenger list dataset

    In the Titanic passenger list dataset,
    investigate the family size of the passengers (i.e. the "SibSp" column).

    - What different family sizes exist in the passenger list? Hint: try the :meth:`~pandas.Series.unique` method
    - What are the names of the people in the largest family group?
    - (Advanced) Create histograms showing the distribution of family sizes for
      passengers split by the fare, i.e. one group of high-fare passengers (where
      the fare is above average) and one for low-fare passengers
      (Hint: instead of an existing column name, you can give a lambda function
      as a parameter to :meth:`~pandas.DataFrame.hist` to compute a value on the fly. For example
      ``lambda x: "Poor" if df["Fare"].loc[x] < df["Fare"].mean() else "Rich"``).

   .. solution::

       - Existing family sizes::

	   titanic["SibSp"].unique()

       - We get 8 from above.  There is no ``Name`` column, since we
	 made ``Name`` the index when we loaded the dataframe with
	 ``read_csv``, so we use :attr:`pandas.DataFrame.index` to get
	 the names.  So, names of members of largest family(ies)::

	   titanic[titanic["SibSp"] == 8].index

       - Histogram of family size based on fare class::

	   titanic.hist("SibSp",
			lambda x: "Poor" if titanic["Fare"].loc[x] < titanic["Fare"].mean() else "Rich",
			rwidth=0.9)




Time series superpowers
-----------------------

An introduction of pandas wouldn't be complete without mention of its
special abilities to handle time series. To show just a few examples,
we will use a new dataset of Nobel prize laureates available through
an API of the Nobel prize organisation at
https://api.nobelprize.org/v1/laureate.csv .

Unfortunately this API does not allow "non-browser requests", so
:obj:`pandas.read_csv` will not work directly on it. Instead, we put a
local copy on Github which we can access (the original data is CC-0,
so we are allowed to do this).  (Aside: if you do JupyterLab →
File → Open from URL → paste the URL above, it will open it in
JupyterLab *and* download a copy for your use.)

We can then load and explore the data::

    nobel = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/AaltoSciComp/python-for-scicomp/raw/master/resources/data/laureate.csv")
    nobel.head()

This dataset has three columns for time, "born"/"died" and "year".
These are represented as strings and integers, respectively, and
need to be converted to datetime format.  :func:`pandas.to_datetime`
makes this easy::

    # the errors='coerce' argument is needed because the dataset is a bit messy
    nobel["born"] = pd.to_datetime(nobel["born"], errors ='coerce')
    nobel["died"] = pd.to_datetime(nobel["died"], errors ='coerce')
    nobel["year"] = pd.to_datetime(nobel["year"], format="%Y")

Pandas knows a lot about dates (using :ref:`/user_guide/basics.rst#dt-accessor`)::

    print(nobel["born"].dt.day)
    print(nobel["born"].dt.year)
    print(nobel["born"].dt.weekday)

We can add a column containing the (approximate) lifespan in years rounded
to one decimal::

    nobel["lifespan"] = round((nobel["died"] - nobel["born"]).dt.days / 365, 1)

and then plot a :meth:`histogram <pandas.DataFrame.hist>` of lifespans::

    nobel.hist(column='lifespan', bins=25, figsize=(8,10), rwidth=0.9)

Finally, let's see one more example of an informative plot (:meth:`~pandas.DataFrame.boxplot`)
produced by a single line of code::

    nobel.boxplot(column="lifespan", by="category")



Exercises 3
-----------

.. challenge:: Analyze the Nobel prize dataset

    - What country has received the largest number of Nobel prizes, and how many?
      How many countries are represented in the dataset? Hint: use the :obj:`~pandas.Series.describe` method
      on the ``bornCountryCode`` column.
    - Create a histogram of the age when the laureates received their Nobel prizes.
      Hint: follow the above steps we performed for the lifespan.
    - List all the Nobel laureates from your country.

    Now more advanced steps:

    - Now define an array of 4 countries of your choice and extract
      only laureates from these countries (you need to look at the
      data and find how countries are written, and replace ``COUNTRY``
      with those strings)::

	  countries = np.array([COUNTRY1, COUNTRY2, COUNTRY3, COUNTRY4])
	  subset = nobel.loc[nobel['bornCountry'].isin(countries)]

    - Use :meth:`~pandas.DataFrame.groupby` to compute how many nobel prizes each country received in
      each category. The :meth:`~pandas.core.groupby.GroupBy.size` method tells us how many rows, hence nobel
      prizes, are in each group::

	  nobel.groupby(['bornCountry', 'category']).size()

    - (Optional) Create a pivot table to view a spreadsheet like structure, and view it

	- First add a column “number” to the nobel dataframe containing 1’s
	  (to enable the counting below).  We need to make a copy of
	  ``subset``, because right now it is only a view::

	      subset = subset.copy()
	      subset.loc[:, 'number'] = 1

	- Then create the :meth:`~pandas.DataFrame.pivot_table`::

	    table = subset.pivot_table(values="number", index="bornCountry", columns="category", aggfunc=np.sum)

    - (Optional) Install the **seaborn** visualization library if you don't
      already have it, and create a heatmap of your table::

	  import seaborn as sns
	  sns.heatmap(table,linewidths=.5);

    - Play around with other nice looking plots::

	sns.violinplot(y=subset["year"].dt.year, x="bornCountry", inner="stick", data=subset);

      ::

	sns.swarmplot(y="year", x="bornCountry", data=subset, alpha=.5);

      ::

	subset_physchem = nobel.loc[nobel['bornCountry'].isin(countries) & (nobel['category'].isin(['physics']) | nobel['category'].isin(['chemistry']))]
	sns.catplot(x="bornCountry", y="year", col="category", data=subset_physchem, kind="swarm");

      ::

	sns.catplot(x="bornCountry", col="category", data=subset_physchem, kind="count");


   .. solution::

      Below is solutions for the basic steps, advanced steps are
      inline above.

      We use the :meth:`describe` method:

      ::

	 nobel.bornCountryCode.describe()
	 # count     956
	 # unique     81
	 # top        US
	 # freq      287

      We see that the US has received the largest number of Nobel prizes,
      and 81 countries are represented.

      To calculate the age at which laureates receive their prize, we need
      to ensure that the "year" and "born" columns are in datetime format::

	nobel["born"] = pd.to_datetime(nobel["born"], errors ='coerce')
	nobel["year"] = pd.to_datetime(nobel["year"], format="%Y")

      Then we add a column with the age at which Nobel prize was received
      and plot a histogram::

	nobel["age_nobel"] = round((nobel["year"] - nobel["born"]).dt.days / 365, 1)
	nobel.hist(column="age_nobel", bins=25, figsize=(8,10), rwidth=0.9)

      We can print names of all laureates from a given country, e.g.::

	nobel[nobel["country"] == "Sweden"].loc[:, "firstname":"surname"]

Beyond the basics
-----------------

Larger DataFrame operations might be faster using :func:`~pandas.eval` with string expressions, `see
<https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.12-performance-eval-and-query.html>`__::

	import pandas as pd
	# Make some really big dataframes
	nrows, ncols = 100000, 100
	rng = np.random.RandomState(42)
	df1, df2, df3, df4 = (pd.DataFrame(rng.rand(nrows, ncols))
			      for i in range(4))

Adding dataframes the pythonic way yields::

	%timeit df1 + df2 + df3 + df4
	# 80ms

And by using :func:`~pandas.eval`::

	%timeit pd.eval('df1 + df2 + df3 + df4')
	# 40ms


We can assign function return lists as dataframe columns::

	def fibo(n):
	    """Compute Fibonacci numbers. Here we skip the overhead from the
	    recursive function calls by using a list. """
	    if n < 0:
		raise NotImplementedError('Not defined for negative values')
	    elif n < 2:
		return n
	    memo = [0]*(n+1)
	    memo[0] = 0
	    memo[1] = 1
	    for i in range(2, n+1):
		memo[i] = memo[i-1] + memo[i-2]
	    return memo

	df = pd.DataFrame({'Generation': np.arange(100)})
	df['Number of Rabbits'] = fibo(99)  # Assigns list to column


There is much more to Pandas than what we covered in this lesson. Whatever your
needs are, chances are good there is a function somewhere in its `API
<https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/>`__.  You should try to get good at
searching the web for an example showing what you can do. And when
there is not, you can always
apply your own functions to the data using :obj:`~pandas.DataFrame.apply`::


    from functools import lru_cache

    @lru_cache
    def fib(x):
	"""Compute Fibonacci numbers. The @lru_cache remembers values we
	computed before, which speeds up this function a lot."""
	if x < 0:
	    raise NotImplementedError('Not defined for negative values')
	elif x < 2:
	    return x
	else:
	    return fib(x - 2) + fib(x - 1)

    df = pd.DataFrame({'Generation': np.arange(100)})
    df['Number of Rabbits'] = df['Generation'].apply(fib)


Note that the numpy precision for integers caps at int64 while python ints are unbounded --
limited by memory size. Thus, the result from fibonacci(99) would be erroneous when
using numpy ints. The type of df['Number of Rabbits'][99] given by both functions above
is in fact <class 'int'>.


.. keypoints::

   - pandas dataframes are a good data structure for tabular data
   - Dataframes allow both simple and advanced analysis in very compact form
