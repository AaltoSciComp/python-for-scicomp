Other useful Scientific Python libraries
========================================

A few other widely used libraries in the Scientific Python ecosystem:

- `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_: Python Data Analysis
  library. Pandas gives Python a dataframe type, similar to data
  frames in R, which is useful for representing tabular data where
  every column can be of a different type. If you're interested in
  this topic, see the *Practical R and Python Data Analysis* course by
  Aalto Science-IT.

- `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org>`_: Machine Learning
  library. Implementations of the most common ML algorithms such as
  SVM, random forest, k-means, etc.

- `Seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org/>`_: Statistical data
  visualization. Plotting library that builds on top of matplotlib,
  providing a higher level interface aimed at visualizing statistical
  data.

- `Cython <https://cython.org/>`_: C-extensions for Python. Write fast
  C code in an extended subset of Python syntax.

- `Numba <https://numba.pydata.org/>`_: JIT compiler that can
  accelerate (some) loops with NumPy expressions.

- `MPI for Python (mpi4py) <https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io>`_: Python
  bindings for the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard for
  creating parallel applications using Python.

- `SymPy <https://www.sympy.org>`_: Symbolic mathematics in Python.
