```


## Repeatability/reproducibility

From [Claus O. Wilke: "Fundamentals of Data Visualization"](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/):

> *One thing I have learned over the years is that automation is your friend. I
> think figures should be autogenerated as part of the data analysis pipeline
> (which should also be automated), and they should come out of the pipeline
> ready to be sent to the printer, no manual post-processing needed.*

- **No manual post-processing**. This will bite you when you need to regenerate 50
  figures one day before submission deadline or regenerate a set of figures
  after the person who created them left the group.
- There is not the one perfect language and **not the one perfect library** for everything.
- Within Python, many libraries exist:
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html):
    probably the most standard and most widely used
  - [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html):
    high-level interface to Matplotlib, statistical functions built in
  - [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html):
    declarative visualization (R users will be more at home), statistics built in
  - [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/):
    interactive graphs
  - [Bokeh](https://demo.bokeh.org/):
    also here good for interactivity
  - [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/):
    implementation of a grammar of graphics in Python, it is based on [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
  - [ggplot](https://yhat.github.io/ggpy/):
    R users will be more at home
  - [PyNGL](https://www.pyngl.ucar.edu/Examples/gallery.shtml):
    used in the weather forecast community
  - [K3D](https://k3d-jupyter.org/showcase/):
    Jupyter notebook extension for 3D visualization
  - ...
- Two main families of libraries: procedural (e.g. Matplotlib) and declarative
  (using grammar of graphics).


## Why are we starting with Matplotlib?

- Matplotlib is perhaps the most "standard" Python plotting library.
- Many libraries build on top of Matplotlib.
- MATLAB users will feel familiar.
- Even if you choose to use another library (see above list), chances are high
  that you need to adapt a Matplotlib plot of somebody else.
- Libraries that are built on top of Matplotlib may need knowledge of Matplotlib
  for custom adjustments.

However it is a relatively low-level interface for
drawing (in terms of abstractions, not in terms of quality) and does not
provide statistical functions. Some figures require typing and tweaking many lines of code.

Many other visualization libraries exist with their own strengths, it is also a
matter of personal preferences. **Later we will also try other libraries.**


## Getting started with Matplotlib

We can start in a Jupyter notebook since notebooks are typically a good fit
for data visualizations. But if you prefer to run this as a script, this is
also OK.

Let us create our first plot using
{func}`~matplotlib.pyplot.subplots`,
{obj}`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.scatter`, and some other methods on the
{obj}`~matplotlib.axes.Axes` object:

```{code-block} python
# this line tells Jupyter to display matplotlib figures in the notebook
%matplotlib inline

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# this is dataset 1 from
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet
data_x = [10.0, 8.0, 13.0, 9.0, 11.0, 14.0, 6.0, 4.0, 12.0, 7.0, 5.0]
data_y = [8.04, 6.95, 7.58, 8.81, 8.33, 9.96, 7.24, 4.26, 10.84, 4.82, 5.68]

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.scatter(x=data_x, y=data_y, c="#E69F00")

ax.set_xlabel("we should label the x axis")
ax.set_ylabel("we should label the y axis")
ax.set_title("some title")

# uncomment the next line if you would like to save the figure to disk
# fig.savefig("my-first-plot.png")
```

```{figure} data-visualization/first-plot/getting-started.png
:alt: Result of our first plot

This is the result of our first plot.
```

When running a Matplotlib script on a remote server without a
"display" (e.g. compute cluster), you may need to add the
{obj}`matplotlib.use` call:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
matplotlib.use("Agg")

# ... rest of the script
```

## Exercise: Matplotlib

````{challenge} Exercise Matplotlib-1: extend the previous example (15 min)
- Extend the previous plot by also plotting this set of values but this time
  using a different color (`#56B4E9`):
  ```python
  # this is dataset 2
  data2_y = [9.14, 8.14, 8.74, 8.77, 9.26, 8.10, 6.13, 3.10, 9.13, 7.26, 4.74]
  ```

- Then add another color (`#009E73`) which plots the second dataset, scaled
  by 2.0.
  ```python
  # here we multiply all elements of data2_y by 2.0
  data2_y_scaled = [y*2.0 for y in data2_y]
  ```

- Try to add a legend to the plot with {meth}`matplotlib.axes.Axes.legend` and searching the web for clues on
  how to add labels to each dataset.

- At the end it should look like this one:
   ```{figure} data-visualization/first-plot/exercise.png
   :alt: Result of the exercise
   ```

```{discussion} Why these colors?
This qualitative color palette is opimized for all color-vision
deficiencies, see <https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/color-pitfalls.html> and

## Matplotlib has two different interfaces

When plotting with Matplotlib, it is useful to know and understand that
there are **two approaches** even though the reasons of this dual approach is
outside the scope of this lesson.

- The more modern option is an **object-oriented interface** (the
  {class}`fig <matplotlib.figure.Figure>` and {class}`ax <matplotlib.axes.Axes>` objects
  can be configured separately and passed around to functions):
   ```{code-block} python
   ---
   emphasize-lines: 8-14
   ---
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # this is dataset 1 from
   # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet
   data_x = [10.0, 8.0, 13.0, 9.0, 11.0, 14.0, 6.0, 4.0, 12.0, 7.0, 5.0]
   data_y = [8.04, 6.95, 7.58, 8.81, 8.33, 9.96, 7.24, 4.26, 10.84, 4.82, 5.68]

   fig, ax = plt.subplots()

   ax.scatter(x=data_x, y=data_y, c="#E69F00")

   ax.set_xlabel("we should label the x axis")
   ax.set_ylabel("we should label the y axis")
   ax.set_title("some title")
   ```

- The more traditional option mimics MATLAB plotting and uses the
  **pyplot interface** (:py:mod:`plt <matplotlib.pyplot>` carries
  the global settings):
   ```{code-block} python
   ---
   emphasize-lines: 8-12
   ---
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # this is dataset 1 from
   # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet
   data_x = [10.0, 8.0, 13.0, 9.0, 11.0, 14.0, 6.0, 4.0, 12.0, 7.0, 5.0]
   data_y = [8.04, 6.95, 7.58, 8.81, 8.33, 9.96, 7.24, 4.26, 10.84, 4.82, 5.68]

   plt.scatter(x=data_x, y=data_y, c="#E69F00")

   plt.xlabel("we should label the x axis")
   plt.ylabel("we should label the y axis")
   plt.title("some title")
   ```

When searching for help on the internet, you will find both approaches, they
can also be mixed. Although the pyplot interface looks more compact, **we
recommend to learn and use the object oriented interface.**

```{discussion} Why do we emphasize this?
One day you may want to write functions which wrap
around Matplotlib function calls and then you can send {class}`~matplotlib.figure.Figure` and {class}`~matplotlib.axes.Axes`
into these functions and there is less risk that adjusting figures changes
settings also for unrelated figures created in other functions.

When using the pyplot interface, settings are modified for the entire
{mod}`matplotlib.pyplot` package. The latter is acceptable for linear scripts but may yield
surprising results when introducing functions to enhance/abstract Matplotlib
calls.
```

## Styling and customizing plots

- **Do not customize "manually"** using a graphical program (not easily repeatable/reproducible).
- **No manual post-processing**. This will bite you when you need to regenerate 50
  figures one day before submission deadline or regenerate a set of figures
  after the person who created them left the group.
- Matplotlib and also all the other libraries allow to customize almost every aspect of a plot.
- It is useful to study [Matplotlib parts of a figure](https://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#parts-of-a-figure)
  so that we know what to search for to customize things.
- Matplotlib cheatsheets: <https://github.com/matplotlib/cheatsheets>
- You can also select among pre-defined themes/
  [style
  sheets](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/style_sheets/style_sheets_reference.html)
  with {obj}`~matplotlib.style.use`, for instance:
  ```python
  plt.style.use('ggplot')
  ```


## Exercises: Styling and customization

Here are 3 exercises where we try to adapt existing scripts to either **tweak
how the plot looks** (exercises 1 and 2) or to **modify the input data** (example 3).

This is very close to real life: there are so many options and possibilities and it is
almost impossible to remember everything so this strategy is useful to practice:
- select an example that is close to what you have in mind
- being able to adapt it to your needs
- being able to search for help
- being able to understand help request answers (not easy)

````{challenge} Exercise Customization-1: log scale in Matplotlib (15 min)
In this exercise we will learn how to use log scales.

- To demonstrate this we first fetch some data to plot:
  ```python
  import pandas as pd

  url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/gapminder_with_codes.csv"
  data = pd.read_csv(url)

  data_2007 = data[data["year"] == 2007]

  data_2007
  ```
- Try the above snippet in a notebook and it will give you an overview over the data.

- Then we can plot the data, first using a linear scale:
  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  fig, ax = plt.subplots()

  ax.scatter(x=data_2007["gdpPercap"], y=data_2007["lifeExp"], alpha=0.5)

  ax.set_xlabel("GDP (USD) per capita")
  ax.set_ylabel("life expectancy (years)")
  ```

  This is the result but we realize that a linear scale is not ideal here:
  ```{figure} data-visualization/customizing/gapminder-linear.png
  :alt: Gapminder data plotted using a linear scale
  ```

- Your task is to switch to a log scale and arrive at this result:
  ```{figure} data-visualization/customizing/gapminder-log.png
  :alt: Gapminder data plotted using log scale
  ```

- What does ``alpha=0.5`` do?
````

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.scatter(x=data_2007["gdpPercap"], y=data_2007["lifeExp"], alpha=0.5)

ax.set_xscale("log")

ax.set_xlabel("GDP (USD) per capita")
ax.set_ylabel("life expectancy (years)")
```
* {obj}`alpha <matplotlib.artist.Artist.set_alpha>` sets transparency
  of points.
````

````{challenge} Exercise Customization-2: preparing a plot for publication (15 min)
Often we need to create figures for presentation slides and for publications
but both have different requirements: for presentation slides you have the whole
screen but for a figure in a publication you may only have few centimeters/inches.

For figures that go to print it is good practice to look at them at the size
they will be printed in and then often fonts and tickmarks are too small.

Your task is to make the tickmarks and the axis label font larger, using
[Matplotlib parts of a figure](https://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#parts-of-a-figure)
and web search, and to arrive at this:

```{figure} data-visualization/customizing/gapminder-larger-font.png
:alt: Gapminder data plotted with larger font and larger ticks
```

ax.set_xlabel("GDP (USD) per capita", fontsize=15)
ax.set_ylabel("life expectancy (years)", fontsize=15)
ax.tick_params(which="major", length=10)
ax.tick_params(which="minor", length=5)
ax.tick_params(labelsize=15)
```
````

````{challenge} Exercise Customization-3: adapting a gallery example
**This is a great exercise which is very close to real life.**

- Your task is to select one visualization library (some need to be installed first - in
  doubt choose Matplotlib or Seaborn since they are part of Anaconda installation):
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html):
    probably the most standard and most widely used
  - [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html):
    high-level interface to Matplotlib, statistical functions built in
  - [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html):
    declarative visualization (R users will be more at home), statistics built in
  - [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/):
    interactive graphs
  - [Bokeh](https://demo.bokeh.org/):
    also here good for interactivity
  - [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/):
    implementation of a grammar of graphics in Python, it is based on [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
  - [ggplot](https://yhat.github.io/ggpy/):
    R users will be more at home
  - [PyNGL](https://www.pyngl.ucar.edu/Examples/gallery.shtml):
    used in the weather forecast community
  - [K3D](https://k3d-jupyter.org/showcase/):
    Jupyter notebook extension for 3D visualization

- Browse the various example galleries (links above).
- Select one example that is close to your recent visualization project or simply interests you.
- First try to reproduce this example in the Jupyter notebook.
- Then try to print out the data that is used in this example just before the call of the plotting function
  to learn about its structure. Is it a pandas dataframe? Is it a NumPy array? Is it a dictionary? A list?
  a list of lists?
- Then try to modify the data a bit.
- If you have time, try to feed it different, simplified data.
  This will be key for adapting the examples to your projects.

Example "solution" for such an exploration below.
````

````{solution} An example exploration
- Let us imagine we were browsing <https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html>
- And this example plot caught our eye: <https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/simple_violinplots.html>
- Try to run it in the notebook.
- The `d` seems to be the data. Right before the call to `sns.violinplot`, add a `print(d)`:
  ```{code-block} python
  ---
  emphasize-lines: 12
  ---
  import numpy as np
  import seaborn as sns

  sns.set_theme()

  # Create a random dataset across several variables
  rs = np.random.default_rng(0)
  n, p = 40, 8
  d = rs.normal(0, 2, (n, p))
  d += np.log(np.arange(1, p + 1)) * -5 + 10

  print(d)

  # Show each distribution with both violins and points
  sns.violinplot(data=d, palette="light:g", inner="points", orient="h")
  ```
- The print reveals that `d` is a NumPy array and looks like a two-dimensional list:
  ```text
  [[10.25146044  6.27005437  5.78778386  3.27832843  0.88147169  1.76439276  2.87844934  1.49695422]
   [ 8.59252953  4.00342116  3.26038963  3.15118015 -2.69725111  0.60361933 -2.22137264 -1.86174242]
   ... many more lines ...
   [12.45950762  4.32352988  6.56724895  3.42215312  0.34419915  0.46123886 -1.56953795  0.95292133]]
  ```
- Now let's try with a much simplified two-dimensional list:
  ```{code-block} python
  ---
  emphasize-lines: 12, 13
  ---
  # import numpy as np
  import seaborn as sns

  sns.set_theme()

  # # Create a random dataset across several variables
  # rs = np.random.default_rng(0)
  # n, p = 40, 8
  # d = rs.normal(0, 2, (n, p))
  # d += np.log(np.arange(1, p + 1)) * -5 + 10

  d = [[1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0],
       [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 3.0]]

  # Show each distribution with both violins and points
  sns.violinplot(data=d, palette="light:g", inner="points", orient="h")
  ```
- Seems to work! And finally we arrive at a working example with our own data with all
  the "clutter" removed:
  ```python
  import seaborn as sns

  # l1 and l2 are note great names but they will do for a quick test
  l1 = [1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]
  l2 = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 3.0]

  sns.violinplot(data=[l1, l2], palette="light:g", inner="points", orient="h")
  ```
- And now we can focus the rest of our work to read our real data.
- Finally we can customize the plot, e.g. web search for "seaborn violin plot axis labels"
  and add `ax.set_yticklabels(['dataset 1', 'dataset 2'])`.

```{discussion}
After the exercises, the group can discuss their findings and it is important to
clarify questions at this point before moving on.
```

```{keypoints}
- Avoid manual post-processing, script everything.
- Browse a number of example galleries to help you choose the library
  that fits best your work/style.
- Figures for presentation slides and figures for manuscripts have
  different requirements.
- Think about color-vision deficiencies when choosing colors. Use
  existing solutions for this problem.
