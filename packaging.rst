Packaging
=========

.. questions::

   - How to organize larger Python projects?
   - How can you make your Python functions most usable by your collaborators?
   - How to prepare your code to make a Python package?
   - How to publish your Python package?

.. objectives::

   - Learn to identify the components of a Python package
   - Learn to create a Python package
   - Learn to publish a Python package


Organizing Python projecs into modules
--------------------------------------

what is ``__init__.py`` and relative imports.


Birds-eye view of PyPI, pip, and Conda
--------------------------------------


Python packages
---------------

.. challenge:: Packaging 1

  TODO: - Create a very simple Python package and make it pip-installable
        - Test to install it locally


Submit your package to PyPI
---------------------------

TODO:
- Show what is required. Remind about the importance of documentation, license, etc.
- Test-PyPI


Tools that simplify sharing via PyPI
------------------------------------

- poetry
- flit


Building a conda package and share it
-------------------------------------

TODO: for information. Here we may link to other training material. We won't really discuss it but mostly mention it.

- public conda channels have own workflows/rules


Version pinning
---------------

When to pin and when not to pin.


.. keypoints::

   - Organize your code for publishing
   - Pypi
   - conda
